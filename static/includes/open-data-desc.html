<h2>Improving the health of our cities</h2><p class="lead">TULIP is the Technology for Urban Liveability Project, deploying a network of environmental sensors across inner Sydney to gather detailed real-time data about air quality, urban heat and noise. The network is enabled by LoRaWAN Internet of Things technology, which is allowing a range of disruptive activites to grow in the Smart Cities space. The data generated by TULIP will be unprecedented and will act as a powerful driver of change in planning, development and public policy, as well as offering an array of dynamic new business opportunities.</p></div>
