<h2>A digital catalyst for change</h2><p class="lead">TULIP is a voice for building liveable urban communities that are clean, cool and quiet. We want to reduce traffic congestion, harmful gases and smog, minimise the urban heat island effect and cut noise pollution. We want fresh air, more green space, improved bike and pedestrian infrastructure and world-class sustainable design across buildings and public spaces.</p><p class="lead">We're applying the latest in Internet of Things sensor technology to create a public data feed of environmental sensors. The design is now open-source, so you can build a sensor and contribute to the network in your city.</p></div>
